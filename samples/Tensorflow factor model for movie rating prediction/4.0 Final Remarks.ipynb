We ran a simple script for addressing the artifacts and preprocessed the data. Finally, we used a TensorFlow model called WALS for building a collaborative filtering latent factor model. "

    "Our model did not use two interesting part of the Movielens data: timestamps on each movie ratings, and movie genre information. Each  movie is soft clustered into a collection of very generic genres (Action, Comedy, Western, etc). It might be interesting to first cluster the movies using the genre information (or by any other method) and building a WALS model for each cluster. Then the ratings from each cluster model can be combined somehow to produce a final rating. There is lots of room for innovation in prediction movie ratings! "
